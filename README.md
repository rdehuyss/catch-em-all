# Java-Dex

A small Top Trumps style card game with 20 original cards about the Java world: Duke, frameworks, build tools, parts of the JVM and a few villains. Every card has a job title, three made-up stats and one real number, the age of the project.

The cards were made for a live-coding session about training an image classifier with Java, Spring AI and JobRunr. Hold a card in front of a webcam, the classifier names it, and the game plays the round. The classifier app will be added to this repository.

## How to play

Two players, 10 cards each, face down. Read the full rules in [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md).

1. The starting player looks at their top card and picks one of four stats: Startup, Clean, Community or Age.
2. Both players reveal their top card. The higher number wins both cards.
3. On a tie, both cards go to the bottom of their piles.
4. The winner picks the next stat. Whoever holds all cards, or the most after 10 rounds, wins.
